<h1>All about raccoons!!</h1>
    <h3 id="information">Basic info</h3>
<p class="raccoons">Raccoons are very adaptable so they live in a wide range of climates and habitats.Raccoons are round fuzzy creatures with bushy tails and a black mask of fur that covers their eye area. These animals may look like cute cuddly bandits but they can be quite fearsome when approached..The raccoon, sometimes called the common raccoon to distinguish it from other species, is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm, and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg.  </p>

At night you have good eyesight<br>

They're powerful and they can fight<br>

They're always found near trees <br>
